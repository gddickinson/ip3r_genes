## 2026-08-18 — S-setup: project created

**What ran.** Created this project as a working copy of the PIEZO project's
machinery pointed at the IP3-receptor family.

Ported from `../piezo_genes` and adapted:

- `src/` — the whole app (databases, analysis, discovery, investigation,
  GUI, CLI). The family is now defined in exactly one place,
  `src/utils/family.py`; nothing else in `src/` hard-codes a gene name.
  `interpro.has_piezo_signature` / `batch_fetch_piezo_signatures` became
  `has_family_signature` / `batch_fetch_family_signatures` and read their
  Pfam list from there. Verified: every module imports and the wiring
  resolves to the ITPR constants.
- `src/utils/data_root.py` — added `require_data_root()` and
  `python -m src.utils.data_root --require`, which exits non-zero when the
  external drive is absent. The old behaviour silently fell back to the
  internal disk, which is fine for a cached API page and fatal for a
  400 GB genome download.
- `scripts/dashboard.py` — the PIEZO-specific sweep probes were replaced by
  the generic `results/session_live.json` contract, figures are now
  auto-discovered from `results/*/figures/*.png` as well as listed
  explicitly, and the ledger parser now accepts sub-task ids (S14a), which
  the original silently skipped.
- `scripts/figstyle.py` — palette re-keyed to ITPR1/2/3 with the ryanodine
  receptors as a distinct accent group.
- `scripts/s14_*.py`, `build_findings_page.py` — the manuscript-assembly,
  claim-checking, deposit and findings-page machinery, with the figure map
  and section list set to this project's plan and the claims list emptied
  down to a worked example of each operation.
- `presets/` — six ITPR presets, including a domain scan that excludes the
  ryanodine receptors explicitly.

**What was checked live** (not assumed):

- UniProt: Q14643 / Q14571 / Q14573 are human ITPR1/2/3 at 2,758 / 2,701 /
  2,671 aa; P21817 / Q92736 / Q15413 are RYR1/2/3 at 5,038 / 4,967 /
  4,870 aa.
- InterPro: PF08709 (Ins145_P3_rec), PF01365 (RIH), PF08454 (RIH_assoc),
  PF02815 (MIR) — and human RYR1 carries **all four**, which is why D14
  exists.
- Taxonomic distribution of PF08709 and PF01365 across Metazoa, SAR,
  Discoba, Fungi, Viridiplantae, Amoebozoa, bacteria, archaea and several
  named species. Recorded in `docs/ip3r_background.md` §4 as a planning
  snapshot to be re-derived in S2.
- Zebrafish carries itpr1a, itpr1b, itpr2, itpr3 (2,634–2,819 aa), with
  RyRs returned by the same query at 4,856–5,109 aa.

**What was written.** `PUBLICATION_ROADMAP.md` (27-task ledger, session
protocol, storage rules, and the Decisions log D0–D17 carrying the PIEZO
project's methodological rules forward), `docs/session_briefs.md` (a brief
per ledger row), `docs/ip3r_background.md`, `docs/analysis_catalogue.md`,
`CLAUDE.md`, `INTERFACE.md`, `README.md`, `FINDINGS.md`, `roadmap.md`,
`manuscript/README.md`.

**Smoke tests run** (the point being to prove the port works, not to
produce results — nothing was saved into `results/`):

- `--preset ip3r --species "Homo sapiens"` → **115 variants**: NCBI 43,
  UniProt 31, Ensembl 41.
- `--preset ip3r_discovery --analyze --discover` → 56 variants, 35 with
  sequences aligned, 8 family-signature blocks derived, **0 novel
  candidates** — the correct answer for a query that returns only the three
  known human paralogs, and a check that the evidence gate is not promoting
  known genes.
- Ensembl REST misbehaved: 45.6 s timeout on the first run, then 55–73 s
  successes, then an HTTP 500. Fixed what could be fixed on this side —
  `EnsemblClient._get` now retries 3× with backoff on read timeouts and 5xx,
  and `src/cli.py` raises the per-request timeout from 45 s to 90 s — and
  logged the rest as an Emergent row. NCBI, UniProt and AlphaFold were
  reliable throughout.

**State.** `results/` is empty by design. `data_root.txt` points at
`/Volumes/FANTOM/IP3R_DATA`; the drive was **not attached** at setup, and
`--require` correctly refuses.

**Next session: S0** — verify every `[lit]` claim in the background
document against primary sources, write `docs/ip3r_review_2026.md`,
re-derive the database snapshot, and smoke-test the app against live APIs.
S0 needs no bulk storage, so it can run before the drive is attached.

## 2026-08-18 — S0: literature baseline + scope confirmation

**Task.** S0 (topmost `pending`, no dependencies). Completed.

**Protocol.** Dashboard opened + watcher backgrounded. No git remote, so
nothing to pull. `python -m src.utils.data_root --require` → **exit 1**: the
FANTOM drive is not attached. S0 needs no bulk storage, so the session
continued on that basis and the drive remains a hard blocker for S4/S5.
Note: the anaconda `base` python has no `biopython`; the `piezo1` env
(Python 3.11.15, biopython 1.87, requests 2.34.2) does, and everything here
ran under it. **S1 should record that env in `toolchain_manifest.txt`.**

**What ran.**

- `scripts/s0_db_snapshot.py` — re-derives every `[db]` number in
  `docs/ip3r_background.md` (InterPro signature counts, taxonomic
  distribution, UniProt reference + sister-family panel, per-protein Pfam
  architecture, the zebrafish PF08709 query). **All reproduced exactly.**
- `scripts/s0_gene_structure.py` — exon counts, genomic spans and cytobands
  for ITPR1/2/3 from Ensembl `lookup/symbol?expand=1`.
- Literature pass — 19 atomic claims extracted from the 11 `[lit]` blocks,
  checked against 51 references (45 primary) via Europe PMC.
- `scripts/s0_report.py` — renders `results/s0_baseline/report.md` purely
  from the committed tables (D13).
- App smoke tests: `--preset ip3r` and `--preset ip3r_zebrafish`.

**Results.**

- **Literature.** 12 claims verified as written, 3 kept but qualified,
  **2 struck**, 1 retagged `[open]`, 1 upgraded to `[db]`.
  `docs/ip3r_review_2026.md` is the verified baseline;
  `results/s0_baseline/lit_claims.tsv` is the audit trail.
- **The exon/span claim was false.** Measured: ITPR1 62 exons / 354,174 bp,
  ITPR2 57 / 497,888 bp, ITPR3 58 / **76,245 bp**. Range is 57–62 exons, not
  58–60, and ITPR3 does not span "hundreds of kb". Span varies **6.5×** across
  paralogs while protein length varies 3 % → Emergent row for S21.
- **"Both families independently expanded to three paralogs" was retagged
  `[open]`** — the independence of the two triplications is question Q2. It
  was about to be an assumption feeding its own answer.
- **Gillespie syndrome was corrected**: both recessive biallelic *and* de novo
  dominant-negative mechanisms. ITPR3's phenotype was extended: p.Arg2524Cys
  causes a multisystemic immunodeficiency, not only CMT1J. Both → S17.
- **D14 was measured, not asserted.** The zebrafish query
  `taxonomy_id:7955 AND xref:pfam-PF08709`, quoted in the planning document
  as evidence for four IP3 receptors, returns **109 records / 10 gene
  symbols — 53 (49 %) of them ryanodine receptors**, including an unnamed
  4,900 aa `LOC101884734`. In that dataset the length band happened to
  separate the families perfectly; that is annotation luck, not a rule.

**The Ensembl problem — two faults, both diagnosed, both addressed.** The
setup session logged "Ensembl REST is unreliable". That was one word for two
different things.

*Fault 1, a per-species stall.* Ensembl is up (`/info/ping` 0.65 s, release
15.12), but **`/xrefs/symbol/homo_sapiens/{symbol}` stalls indefinitely** —
no response, no error, for `BRCA2` as well as `ITPR1` — while the same
endpoint answers in **0.6 s for `danio_rerio`**. That is exactly why the
human preset lost Ensembl entirely while the zebrafish preset got all three
sources. `_symbol_to_ids` now resolves through `/lookup/symbol/`, and falls
back to `xrefs` **only on a clean 404** — never after a transport error,
which would walk straight back into the stall. Measured effect: human ITPR1
went from **0 variants to 24**.

*Fault 2, latency — only visible once fault 1 was fixed.* Ensembl's speed is
unstable: the same 451-byte `lookup/symbol` call measured **0.61 s, 7.61 s
and 13.91 s** in one session, and the `expand=1` call that carries the
transcript/exon payload costs ~12 s every time. One gene in one species is
~12 s at best, 95 s at worst; the default 8-species panel × 3 genes is 24
sequential pairs, i.e. **5–38 minutes**, straddling `run_headless`'s 300 s
budget. Raised to 900 s. Parallelising the per-species loop is the real fix
→ Emergent.

**Four smoke runs, recorded in `results/s0_baseline/smoke_test.tsv`.** The
decisive one is run 4: `--preset ip3r --species "Homo sapiens"` → UniProt 34,
NCBI 44, **Ensembl 41 in 28.5 s, 3/3 sources**. Run 2 (zebrafish) was also
3/3. The 8-species panel is still a 2/3 run for the latency reason above, and
should be driven with `--species` for now.

A retry budget could never have fixed fault 1, and no amount of retrying
diagnoses fault 2 — worth remembering the next time a source "is flaky".

**Files.** `docs/ip3r_review_2026.md` (new); `docs/ip3r_background.md`
(corrected, struck text left visible); `results/s0_baseline/` (11 tables +
report); `scripts/s0_db_snapshot.py`, `scripts/s0_gene_structure.py`,
`scripts/s0_report.py`; `src/databases/ensembl.py` (fix).

**Next session: S1** — toolchain install + the positive/negative control
benchmark. Read `results/s0_baseline/report.md` first: the 49 % RyR
contamination rate is the reason the decoy panel matters, and the fact that
the length band worked perfectly in that one dataset is the reason S1 must
show the *scorer* separates ITPR from RyR without leaning on it.
